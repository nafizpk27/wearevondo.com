__NOTE: Please be aware that the PHP Mailer feature is not functional on the deployed website. To utilize it, you'll need to download the entire project and run it locally on your computer using XAMPP or WAMP.__
__Additionally, you'll have to set up the sender's credentials in the 'mailing/mailingvariables.php' file. In the 'contactme.php' and 'careers.php' files, you should specify the receiver's email address. Don't forget to provide the path to the 'tmp-uploads' folder in 'careers.php' file to store uploaded files.__
